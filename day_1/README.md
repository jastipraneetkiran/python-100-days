# Day 1
Download and Setup PyCharm for Learning

``
In the coming lessons, we'll be using the PyCharm Integrated Development Environment to learn to code. It's a completely free piece of software and is used by professional Python developers across the globe. They also have a handy course template feature, which we'll be using for the beginner parts of the lessons from Day 1 to 15. So while you might have another favourite code editor, I only recommend to use PyCharm for this course.

### Step 1

Download and install Python to your computer. Head over to the official Python website to download the latest version of Python for your computer system. Then complete the installation.

### Step 2

Download the Free Community Edition of PyCharm using the link below:

`IMPORTANT: If you already have PyCharm, make sure you update to the latest version of PyCharm otherwise the steps below might not work!`



### Step 3

Once PyCharm installs successfully, you should see the welcome screen. Click on the Learn tab and click "Enable Access".

### Step 6

It should take you directly to the course. If it does not work, you can also go to File -> Learn and Teach -> Browse Courses.

Next, scroll down to find the course: 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp and click "Start". You can also search for it in the search course area.

Now you should have access to the beginner course (Day 1 - Day 15) on PyCharm. You will be guided through the lessons to go from Task to Task (you can see the task numbers on the right pane e.g. 1 - 6 for Day1).
